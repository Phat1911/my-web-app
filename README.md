#  Responsibility Tracker Web App

## Overview
This is my first serious full-stack project, built to practice real-world backend and frontend development.

The application allows users to take responsibility for completing daily tasks before they expire. Each day, a new task is generated. When a user completes a task, they earn points, and lucky users may appear on the top score leaderboard.

The project focuses on authentication, file handling, database integration, and a modern frontend UI.
